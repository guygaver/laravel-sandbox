#Notes

####Intro
- functions like visit and see are laravel specific methods
- zoomed in scope can describe on a unit level like methods or services, zoomed out scope 
can describe from the user stand point
- "sliming it" refers to writing the least amount to get a test to pass. Some examples like hardcoded 
values instead of dynamic ones
- using underscores is more readable for tests. Remember that tests are not part of the source code.
 so they dont need to be compared against the same standard. Like PSR2 for camelcase methods
 
 
 ####Helpful tips
 - you can use --filter option to only test specific function
